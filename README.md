# Divvun Keyboard

This repository exists for the purposes of triggering CI and CD. It is a kbdgen meta-repository, and basis for the content of the mobile keyboard app.

Edits to the layouts should happen in the keyboard repos in [GiellaLT](https://github.com/giellalt), one repo for each language.
