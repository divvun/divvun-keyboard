This repository exists for the purposes of triggering CI and CD. It is a [kbdgen](https://github.com/divvun/kbdgen) meta-repository, and serves as the basis for the content of the mobile keyboard apps.

Edits to the layouts should happen in the keyboard repos in [GiellaLT](https://github.com/giellalt?q=keyboard-&type=&language=&sort=), one repo for each language.

The installable keyboard apps can be found here:

- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.uit.giella.keyboards.Sami)
- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/th/app/sami-keyboards/id948386025)
